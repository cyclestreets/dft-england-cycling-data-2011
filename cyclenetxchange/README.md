# CycleNetXChange schema

This folder contains three documents originally published on the DfT website, outlining a format "CycleNetXChange" that the original cycling data for TransportDirect was collected in.

CycleNetXChange is a dead format that no-one is using and which was superseded by the tagging system in OSM which is perfectly adequate for representing cycle infrastructure.

The national cycle path network or 'CycleNetXChange' schema defines a format for the exchange of cycle path data. This schema allows information to be collected by different communities to provide cycle journey planners and other navigation products.

CycleNet is based on the Ordnance Survey digital national framework for referencing objects and the integrated transport network schema.
